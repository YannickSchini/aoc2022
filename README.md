# Advent of Code 2022

My take on 2022’s [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/).

# Learnings

- Day2: I’ve played around with Python Enums
- Day3: Using Ordinals was fun
- Day4: Unpacking function results
- Day6: Played with argparse to handle test files
- Day7: I’m really not familiar with tree structures
- Day11: Using a class list to keep track of all class elements (including a __del__ method to keep the list clean), have methods return Callables
- Day18: Implementing the __repr__, __eq__ and __hash__ functions for my custom types was nice (and a first for the __hash__ method for me!)
